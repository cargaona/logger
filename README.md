Logger will be a tool for sending logs to different places in your software. 

Right now it has 2 implementations. One for stdoutput and the other for
cloudwatch.

This is some tooling I made during the last year and I'm creating this repo to
import the solutions and avoid copy pasting in the future.

This code is free. Use it. Change it. Break it. There is no warranty.
